## Quick Start
1.Clone Repository & Switch Branch
git clone https://github.com/yourname/DjangoForEveryone.git  
cd DjangoForEveryone  
git checkout post-tutorial  # Switch to the completed-code branch

2.Environment Setup: Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed, then create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Start Development Server:
python manage.py runserver

## Detailed Project Structure Explanation
Root Directory Files & Folders
README.md: Serves as the project manual, outlining objectives, usage instructions, and architectural overviews, including its role in JimShapedCoding’s Django tutorials.
baseapp: A Django application module containing core tutorial logic, demonstrating key concepts through practical examples.
venv: A Python virtual environment directory isolating project dependencies to prevent conflicts between different projects.

baseapp Application Directory
.idea/: IDE-specific configuration files generated by JetBrains tools, storing workspace settings (e.g., project structure, run configurations).
baseapp/ (Project Configuration):
settings.py: Central configuration file defining database settings (DATABASES), installed applications (INSTALLED_APPS), static/media paths, and security parameters.
urls.py: Defines the URL-to-view mapping for the entire project, using path() or re_path() to route incoming requests.
wsgi.py: WSGI server configuration for production deployment, enabling compatibility with servers like Gunicorn or Nginx.
main/ (Custom Django App):
models.py: Defines database models using Django’s ORM, with fields (e.g., CharField, ForeignKey) and metadata (e.g., Meta class for table options).
views.py: Contains view functions or class-based views (CBVs) that handle HTTP requests, interact with models, and render templates.
urls.py: Sub-routing configuration for the app, organizing app-specific URLs (e.g., /blog/posts/) and including them in the project’s main urls.py.
static/: Stores static assets (CSS, JS, images) served directly by the server, referenced in templates using {% static %} tags.
templates/: Houses HTML templates using Django’s template language, supporting variables ({{ var }}), tags ({% if %}), and inheritance ({% extends %}).
db.sqlite3: Lightweight SQLite database file used for development, ideal for local testing without complex database setup.
manage.py: Command-line tool for Django operations, including startapp, migrate, createsuperuser, and runserver.

venv Virtual Environment Directory
Lib/: Contains Python packages installed in the virtual environment, isolated from the global Python environment to avoid dependency conflicts.
Scripts/ (Windows) or bin/ (Unix): Executable scripts to activate/deactivate the virtual environment (e.g., venv\Scripts\activate on Windows, source venv/bin/activate on Linux/macOS).
pyvenv.cfg: Configuration file recording the virtual environment’s Python version and base path.

images/ Directory
Stores screenshots and visual documentation (e.g., admin interface previews, template-rendered pages) to illustrate key features, aiding visual learners.
